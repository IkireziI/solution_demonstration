RWANDA ORBIT GUARD: Project README
This document provides a technical overview and deployment instructions for the RWANDA ORBIT GUARD platform, an AI-powered system for predictive satellite collision alerting.

 Description


The RWANDA ORBIT GUARD is a proof-of-concept AI/ML solution designed to enhance Space Situational Awareness (SSA) in Rwanda. It provides a predictive collision alerting service to safeguard national assets.

Core Functionality: Trajectory Prediction (Regression) and automated Conjunction Risk Assessment.

AI Model: MultiOutputRegressor(LinearRegression), trained to forecast a satellite's future 3D coordinates (x,y,z).

Key Result: Achieved a highly reliable position prediction accuracy with a Total RMS Error of 6401.09 meters (6.4 km) and an R 
2
  score of 0.9682.

System Interface (Descriptive Mockup): The final design is a web dashboard that translates the prediction into an actionable GREEN/RED alert status. The interface includes a 3D Visualization component (demonstrated conceptually in the video) that highlights the predicted collision path to inform rapid operational decisions.

 How to Set Up the Environment and the Project

This project is built using Python and standard scientific computing libraries.

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to download the project files from GitHub.

 git clone https://github.com/IkireziI/solution_demonstration.git
 cd solution_demonstration

 Install Dependencies:

 pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

Launch the Notebook: Open the core project file, Rwanda Orbit Guard.ipynb, using  Google Colab.

Designs (Interface Description)
The final application is designed for operational clarity, replacing complex numerical analysis with clear visual and numerical alerts.

The RWANDA ORBIT GUARD interface is a web dashboard designed for clarity and action. The primary view features a 3D Earth Visualization where the predicted trajectory of the Rwandan satellite is drawn in GREEN. When the AI model predicts a close approach, the trajectory of the satellite and the threatening debris object are highlighted in RED. A persistent data panel displays the final numerical output: the HIGH COLLISION ALERT status, the Total RMS Error (6401.09 meters), and the Time to Closest Approach (TCA).
